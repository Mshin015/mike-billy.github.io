        <p>Mike Shinholser and Billy Wright have been lifelong friends who had the dream to share their 
            love of sports with the world. These days there are too many talking heads who really don't have any clue what they are talking about
            and just have <a href="https://www.espn.com/" target="_blank">"Hot Takes"</a> and try to shout their opinion the loudest in order to gain followers
            on social media. Mike and Billy are here to offer great analysis and content on Football realted topics.
